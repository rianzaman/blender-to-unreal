# Animation-Rian



## Getting started

To get your started, please install unreal-engine 5.0 ([windows](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download),[linux](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/linux)) and [blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)

You can find an example skeleton in the main.blend file. You will have to install the blender plugin and the unreal engine plugin from this folder and connect blender to unreal engine, using the livelink plugin. Afterwards you should try to remove blender from this step and let the python plugin run with a bvh/fbx file that automatically plays in unreal-engine.
